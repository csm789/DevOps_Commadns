	Puppet: (Sensible way to manage infrastructure as a Code) CookBooks. Puppet luanched in 2005.
	> Puppet is agent based (here we need to install agent in every server), Puppet is Client Side Architecture
	> Puppet is a pull based Configurational Management system and Puppet is Idempoted too used for deploying, configuring and Managing services.
	> Puppet itself needs huge amount of engineering effort to maintain. (Drawback) and Huge amount of CPU and RAM.
	> Puppet had nearly 60 Modules where as Ansible had 2000 modules.
	> Puppet is two things: A language for expressing the desired start (how your node shoudld be configured) and an engine that interprets code written with
	  the puppet Language and applies to the node to bring about the desire state.
	> Puppet language its not exactly a series of instructions like a Shell script and a Ruby Program.
	> To write a programe to Puppet Need Ruby code Expert.
	> Puppet Components 1. Puppet Master 2. Puppet Client 3. Puppet Language 4. Puppet Facter.
	> Puppet Masteris a server component in the Client server model based on open source java Virtual machine application and Provides high performance puppet 
	  master service, Provides an API for Adminnistraiton.
	> Puppet has UI and reporting to each client, this is a adventage.
	> Puppet LifeCycle: Node will collect the Facts and sent to the Puppet Master, than Pupet Master will create Catalog (Catalog is a smiple file) nd Report 
	  back to the Puppet Master.
	 > Puppet Lifecycle is call Puppet RUN.
	 > Puppet DB is an Opensource database, Chaches and store the data genarated during Puppet RUN, can be quaired via API.
	 > Puppet Agent can be server, Cloud, VM, Network.
	 > Fact is a tool which will install during Puppet Agent, which will collect the facts and provided to the Master from Node.
	 > Puppet Language: catalog will discribe the desired state of each managed resources on each slave, Role is a Module, Manifest as YML, Resources.
	 > Puppet can be installed in two way 1. Monolathic Installation and 2. Split Installation.
Puppet Monolathic Installation:
	> Before Installing Hostname should be the Public not Private
	> hostnamectl set-hostname Publicipaddress (command to set the public host name, Naver change Hostname in your Project)
	> Minimum you need to have 2 core Processor and 6GB RAM. (RHEL, CentOS)

	> wget "https://pm.puppet.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi?dist=el&rel=7&arch=x86_64&ver=latest" -O puppet.tar.gz
	> tar zxf puppet.tar.gz
	> cd puppet directory
	> ./puppet-enterprise-installer
	> Copy the Link from the command link and paste in URL and Continue installation, by giving Password
	> In real time we need to go to Settings, Control access and should give the LDAP Credentials so that we can manage the Credentials.
	> Puppet will communicate on 8140 port.
	> To setup a Puppet Agent Just to go unsirned Cet and copy the curl and post on Agaent Server, so that the agent Server will be up and running.
	> curl -k https://ec2-13-56-163-242.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8140/packages/current/install.bash | sudo bash (this curl will install the Puppet agent)
	> puppet agent -t (need to run this command after the curl command)
	> puppet expect us to write in a specific location cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environment/production
	> We classify in site.pp file for which code which server will be apply
	> To Write Puppet we need to install a tool called  Puppet Developement Kit download the Kit 
	   wget "https://pm.puppet.com/cgi-bin/pdk_download.cgi?dist=el&rel=7&arch=x86_64&ver=latest" -O pdk.tar.gz 
	> mv pdk.tar.gz pdk.rpm
    > rmp -ivh pdk.rpm (this will install)
    > I am not getting pdk Developemnt  kit afterinstallation why?
